 * A scope is an additional verification to be made on a permission. When

 * scope to verify.
 *
 * As an example, one could consider hierarchical scopes where EU includes
 * EU/France. If the user has the scope EU on a permission and we verify a
 * permission valid in EU/France, it will be granted. On the contrary if the user
 * has the scope US and we verify a permission valid in EU/France is will not be
 * granted.
 *
 * Often there is no need for hierarchical scopes and the provided {@link SimpleScope}
 * can be used directly. Simple scopes are not hierarchical and are just checked
 * with strict equality.
