 * Because applications represent user data and credentials in different ways,
 * implementations of this interface are application-specific. You are free to
 * acquire a user's principals and credentials however you wish (e.g. web form,
 * Swing form, fingerprint identification, etc) and then submit them to the
 * framework in the form of an implementation of this interface.
 * <p>
 * If your application's authentication process is username/password based (like

 * {@link UsernamePasswordToken UsernamePasswordToken} class, as it is probably
