ERROR_IN_INITIALIZER.fix=Fix the initializer code or remove it from 'META-INF/services/org.seedstack.seed.spi.SeedInitializer'.
INVALID_BINDING=Cannot bind '${from}' to '${target}' because it cannot be assigned to it.
INVALID_BINDING.fix=Ensure that '${target}' is a subclass of or implements '${from}'.
INVALID_CLASS_CONFIGURATION=Class configuration node of class '${class}' is of type '${nodeType}' (only map nodes are allowed).

MISSING_SEEDSTACK_LAUNCHER=No SeedStack entry point was found in the classpath.
MISSING_SEEDSTACK_LAUNCHER.fix=Exactly one class implementing 'org.seedstack.seed.spi.SeedLauncher' should be present in the classpath and registered in META-INF/services. For instance, the 'seed-cli' module provides a launcher for CLI applications and the 'seed-web-undertow' module provides a launcher for Web application with an embedded Web server.
MULTIPLE_SEEDSTACK_LAUNCHERS=There are multiple SeedStack entry points in the classpath.
MULTIPLE_SEEDSTACK_LAUNCHERS.fix=Exactly one class implementing 'org.seedstack.seed.spi.SeedLauncher' should be present in the classpath and registered in META-INF/services. Remove all but one launcher.
MULTIPLE_TOOLS_WITH_IDENTICAL_NAMES=Multiple tools with conflicting names ('${toolName}') are present in the classpath.
MULTIPLE_TOOLS_WITH_IDENTICAL_NAMES.fix=Remove all but one of the tools named '${toolName}'.
